# BUILDING-A-CLASSIFICATION-MODEL-WITH-SCIKIT-LEARN
The primary objective of building a classification model using Scikit-learn is to accurately classify or predict categorical outcomes based on input features. This process aims to develop a machine learning model that can generalize well on unseen data, allowing for reliable decision-making or pattern recognition.
